\chapter{The Faddeev-Popov Trick}
\label{chap:fpTrick}

All that remains to be done is to evaluate the gluon propagator.  As in QED when trying
to compute the propagator of a massless gauge boson we can use the work of Faddeev and Popov.
The functional integral we want to evaluate is in the form:

\begin{equation}
	\int DAe^{-\frac{i}{4}\int d^4xF^a_{\mu\nu}F^{a\mu\nu}}.
\end{equation}

Where $DA=\prod_x\prod_{a, \mu}dA^a_\mu$.  As briefly outlined above we would like to perform
a functional integration over all possible gauge choices and then pick out the subset of gauges
we are interested in by enforcing the gauge condition $G(A)=0$ to eliminate over-counting.
This constraint may be written as ~\cite{p&s}:

\begin{equation}
\int D\alpha(x)\delta(G(A^\alpha))Det\left(\frac{\delta G(A^\alpha)}{\delta\alpha(x)}\right) = 1.
\end{equation}

Where $A^\alpha_\mu = A_\mu - \frac{1}{g_s}\partial_\mu\alpha(x)$.  Making a gauge
transformation ($A_\mu\rightarrow A^\alpha_\mu$) and inserting equation (18):

\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
\int DAe^{-\frac{i}{4}\int d^4F^a_{\mu\nu}F^{a\mu\nu}} = \int DA\int D\alpha(x)\delta(G(A^\alpha))
Det\left(\frac{\delta G(A^\alpha)}{\delta\alpha(x)}\right)e^{-\frac{i}{4}\int d^4F^a_{\mu\nu}F^{a\mu\nu}},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
= \int D\alpha(x)\int DA\delta(G(A^\alpha))Det\left(\frac{\delta G(A^\alpha)}{\delta\alpha(x)}\right)
e^{-\frac{i}{4}\int d^4F^a_{\mu\nu}F^{a\mu\nu}}.
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

We are free to change the functional integration variable to $A_\mu^\alpha$ since everything
is gauge invariant leading to an integrand which \emph{only} depends on $A^\alpha_\mu$.
We can therefore simply relabel back to $A_\mu$:

\begin{equation}
= \left(\int D\alpha(x)\right)\int DA\delta(G(A))Det\left(\frac{\delta G(A)}{\delta\alpha(x)}\right)
e^{-\frac{i}{4}\int d^4F^a_{\mu\nu}F^{a\mu\nu}}.
\end{equation}

The functional integration can now just be factored out as a constant and we can choose the
function $G(A)$ as a generalisation of the Lorentz gauge: $G(A)=\partial^\mu A^a_\mu-\omega^a$.
This choice leads us to the correct gluon propagator - along with our free parameter, $\xi$:

\begin{equation}
\langle0|A_a(x)A_b(y)|0\rangle = G_F^{\mu\nu}(x-y) = \int \frac{d^4x}{(2\pi)^4}e^{-ik\cdot(x-y)}
\delta_{ab}\frac{-i}{k^2+i\epsilon}\left(g^{\mu\nu}-(1-\xi)\frac{k^\mu k^\nu}{k^2}\right).
\end{equation}

but because the QCD gauge transformation is more involved than the
QED equivalent the determinant term still depends on $A_\mu$:

\begin{equation}
Det\left(\frac{\delta G(A)}{\delta\alpha(x)}\right) = Det\left(\frac{\partial_\mu D^\mu}{g_s}\right).
\end{equation}

We can however simply invent another type of field and choose to write out determinant as

\begin{equation}
	Det\left(\frac{\delta G(A)}{\delta\alpha(x)}\right) = \int D\chi D\overline{\chi}
	e^{i\int d^4x\overline{\chi}(-\partial_\mu D_\mu)\chi}.
\end{equation}

These non-physical modes are called the Faddeev-Popov ghosts/anti-ghosts and are a consequence
of enforcing gauge invariance - they are represented by the final term in equation (12a).
