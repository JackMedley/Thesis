Firstly I would like to thank Jenni Smillie, my supervisor, for her constant help and encouragement
throughout the course of my Ph.D.  Without this guidance I don't think it would have been possible!

I would also like to thank Jeppe Andersen, Helen Brooks, James Cockburn and Tuomas Hapola, who comprise
the High Energy Jets collaboration, for the help and interesting discussions over the past four years of study.

Many thanks to all the other members of the PPT department and the Feynmen FC football club in
Edinburgh for all of the 9am kick-offs in the snow, coffee breaks and social events.

A special thanks to the amazing Becky Chislett who, aside from listening to me complain about writing up
for the past 4 months, has always been really supportive and has generally made the last two years great.  Thanks
also go to Sam Bartrum and Mark Harley for their friendship, advice, nights out and bouldering tips in
the years I've known them!  The Penzance contingent, of whom there are unfortunately too many to name, also
deserve a big hand for the fun times and constant friendship over the past decade.

Lastly I'd like to thank my parents who have never once failed to be supportive and offer me guidance and love
whenever I have needed it over the past 26 years.  This thesis is dedicated to them as I wouldn't be half
the person I am today without them.
